# ProcPoke
Tools for probing running process in Linux

# Installing 
Pull the code from github with:

``` git clone https://github.com/0ptik41/ProcPoke ```


# Usage
Use `run.py` with `-p` flag followed by a PID. The program will dump what it finds to a file 
(named after the PID given) and also to the console.

## **Still under development :D**
